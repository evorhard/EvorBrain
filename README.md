## 🤔 What Does This Do?

EvorBrain is your personal life management system that helps you organize everything from big life goals down to daily tasks. Think of it as a digital brain that:

- **Organizes your life** into clear areas (Career, Health, Finance, etc.)
- **Breaks down goals** into achievable projects and tasks
- **Stores everything locally** on your computer - you own your data
- **Syncs automatically** using Git for backups and multi-device access
- **Works offline** with the speed of a native desktop app
- **Reads like Obsidian** with human-readable markdown files
- **Functions like Notion** with a beautiful, intuitive interface

Perfect for anyone who wants the power of Notion's organization with Obsidian's local-first philosophy and the performance of a native app.

## 🚀 Installation

> 🚀 **Developer Notice**: The application now runs in development mode! While core functionality like task management isn't implemented yet, you can explore the UI framework and responsive design system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evorhard/evorbrain.git
cd evorbrain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install JavaScript dependencies
bun install

# Install Rust dependencies (handled automatically by Tauri)
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Start the Tauri development server
bun run tauri:dev
# or
bun run start

# The app will launch with:
# - Working UI framework with theme switching
# - Responsive design system
# - Demo components showcasing the design system
# - Database migration system (check MigrationTester component)
# - Hot module replacement for development
```

**Current State**: Both UI foundation and database layer are complete! You can run the app to explore the component library, theme system, responsive design, and test the database migration system. Next milestone: implementing CRUD operations and connecting frontend to backend.

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses Vitest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing.

### Current Testing Status

⚠️ **Important**: Test utilities are fully implemented but have some environment setup limitations:

- **Component Tests**: Some tests fail with "document is not defined" errors due to jsdom configuration issues
- **Router Integration**: Not yet implemented in render helpers (disabled to avoid SSR issues)
- **Test Utilities**: Working correctly as demonstrated by passing example tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (some may fail due to environment issues)
bun test

# Run specific test file (recommended approach)
bun test src/test/utils/example.test.tsx

# Run tests with UI interface
bun run test:ui

# Run tests once (no watch mode)
bun run test:run

# Run E2E tests (fully working)
bun run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage

The project includes comprehensive test coverage reporting using Vitest's built-in coverage support (via c8/v8).

```bash
# Generate coverage report
bun run test:coverage

# Coverage will be generated in ./coverage directory
# Open ./coverage/index.html in your browser for detailed report
```

#### Coverage Configuration

- **Coverage Thresholds**: 80% for statements, functions, and lines; 70% for branches
- **Output Formats**: text, json, html, and lcov
- **Excluded Files**: Test files, configuration files, type definitions, and test utilities

The coverage configuration can be found in `vitest.config.ts`. Coverage reports are automatically excluded from version control.

### Test Utilities

We provide comprehensive test utilities in `src/test/utils/`:
- **TauriMock**: Enhanced mocking for Tauri IPC commands
- **Render Helpers**: Utilities for testing SolidJS components
- **Data Factories**: Functions for generating test data
- **Custom Matchers**: Domain-specific assertions

See the [Test Utilities Documentation](src/test/utils/README.md) for detailed usage and known issues.
